# Backend Startup Fix for Built Application

## Problem
The Python backend was not starting when running the installed/built Electron application on **both Windows and Linux**. The frontend showed an error that the backend was not found.

## Critical Understanding: PyInstaller Cannot Cross-Compile

**The most important thing to understand:** PyInstaller creates platform-specific executables. You **CANNOT** build a Windows executable on Linux, or vice versa.

- Building on **Linux** → creates `pos-server` (Linux executable)
- Building on **Windows** → creates `pos-server.exe` (Windows executable)
- Building on **macOS** → creates `pos-server` (macOS executable)

If you build the Python backend on Linux and then package it for Windows, the Windows installer will contain a Linux executable that won't run on Windows!

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Platform-Specific Executable Name Issue
**Location:** `apps/electron-app/src/main/services/PythonServerManager.ts` (Line 31)

**Problem:** The code was hardcoded to look for `pos-server.exe` (Windows executable), but when building on Linux, the executable is named `pos-server` (without the `.exe` extension).

**Fix:** Made the executable name platform-aware:
```typescript
const isWindows = process.platform === 'win32'
const executableName = isWindows ? 'pos-server.exe' : 'pos-server'
const serverPath = path.join(resourcesPath, 'python-server', 'pos-server', executableName)
```

### 2. Pydantic Validation Error
**Location:** `apps/python-backend/src/config.py` (Line 41-44)

**Problem:** The Python backend was receiving environment variables from Electron (like `VITE_API_URL`, `VITE_APP_NAME`, `VITE_APP_VERSION`) that were not defined in the Pydantic Settings model. Pydantic v2 by default rejects extra fields, causing a validation error:

```
pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError: 3 validation errors for Settings
VITE_API_URL
  Extra inputs are not permitted [type=extra_forbidden, ...]
```

**Fix:** Added `extra = "ignore"` to the Pydantic Config class to ignore unknown environment variables:
```python
class Config:
    """Pydantic configuration"""
    env_file = ".env"
    case_sensitive = True
    extra = "ignore"  # Ignore extra environment variables
```

### 3. Missing Executable Permissions (Linux/Mac)
**Location:** `apps/electron-app/src/main/services/PythonServerManager.ts` (Line 150-157)

**Enhancement:** Added automatic permission setting for the Python server executable on Linux/Mac platforms:
```typescript
// On Linux/Mac, ensure the executable has execute permissions
if (process.platform !== 'win32') {
  try {
    fs.chmodSync(serverExePath, 0o755)
    console.log('Set executable permissions on server binary')
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Failed to set executable permissions:', error)
  }
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **apps/electron-app/src/main/services/PythonServerManager.ts**
   - Made executable name platform-aware
   - Added executable permission setting for Linux/Mac
   - Added better error logging and validation

2. **apps/python-backend/src/config.py**
   - Added `extra = "ignore"` to Pydantic Config to handle extra environment variables

## Testing

After applying the fixes, the backend now starts successfully in the built application:

```bash
✓ Backend is running!
Backend health check response:
{"status":"healthy","service":"POS Backend","database":{"engine":"SQLite","connected":true}}
```

## Build Instructions

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Platform-Specific Builds Required**

PyInstaller **cannot cross-compile**. You MUST build the Python backend on the same platform where you want to run it:

- **For Windows builds**: Build on Windows (creates `pos-server.exe`)
- **For Linux builds**: Build on Linux (creates `pos-server`)
- **For macOS builds**: Build on macOS (creates `pos-server`)

### Building on Linux (for Linux)

```bash
# From project root
./build.sh linux
```

Or manually:
```bash
cd apps/python-backend
source venv/bin/activate
pyinstaller server.spec --clean --noconfirm

cd ../electron-app
pnpm exec vite build
pnpm exec electron-builder --linux --x64
```

### Building on Windows (for Windows)

```cmd
REM From project root
build.bat windows
```

Or manually:
```cmd
cd apps\python-backend
venv\Scripts\activate
pyinstaller server.spec --clean --noconfirm

cd ..\electron-app
pnpm exec vite build
pnpm exec electron-builder --win --x64
```

### Cross-Platform Development

If you need to build for multiple platforms, you have two options:

1. **Use separate build machines** - Build on each target platform
2. **Use CI/CD with multiple runners** - GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc. with platform-specific runners

## Platform Compatibility

These fixes ensure the application works correctly on:
- ✅ Linux (tested - when built on Linux)
- ✅ Windows (when built on Windows)
- ✅ macOS (when built on macOS)

## Solution for Your Specific Case

Since you're experiencing the issue on **both Windows and Linux**, here's what you need to do:

### For Linux Users:
1. Build on a Linux machine:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh linux
   ```
2. Distribute the `.AppImage` or `.deb` file to Linux users

### For Windows Users:
1. Build on a Windows machine:
   ```cmd
   build.bat windows
   ```
2. Distribute the `.exe` installer to Windows users

### If You Only Have One Platform:

**Option 1: Use GitHub Actions (Recommended)**
Set up GitHub Actions to build on multiple platforms automatically. Example workflow:

```yaml
name: Build Multi-Platform
on: [push]
jobs:
  build-windows:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: build.bat windows

  build-linux:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: ./build.sh linux
```

**Option 2: Use a Virtual Machine**
- Install VirtualBox or VMware
- Create a VM for the other platform
- Build inside the VM

**Option 3: Use a Cloud Build Service**
- Use a service like AppVeyor, CircleCI, or Travis CI
- Configure builds for multiple platforms

## Additional Notes

- The Python backend now correctly ignores Electron-specific environment variables
- The executable permissions are automatically set on Unix-like systems
- Better error logging helps diagnose startup issues
- The fix maintains backward compatibility with development mode
- The build script now warns you about platform-specific builds
