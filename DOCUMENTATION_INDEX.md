## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Keyboard Support
- Type PIN using physical keyboard (0-9)
- Press Enter to submit
- Press Backspace to delete
- Press Escape to clear
- Works without focusing on keypad

### Role System
- **Admin**: Full access to all features
- **User**: Limited access (no settings, no user management)
- First user is admin by default
- Subsequent users are regular users

### Touch-Safe Design
- Minimum 44x44px touch targets
- Adequate spacing between elements
- Visual feedback on interactions
- Accessible for all users
