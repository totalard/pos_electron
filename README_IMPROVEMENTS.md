## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. Login Keypad Layout Redesign ✅
**File**: `apps/electron-app/src/renderer/components/NumericKeypad.tsx`

**Features:**
- Tight grid layout with compact spacing (gap-2)
- Full keyboard support (0-9, Enter, Backspace, Escape)
- Full-width submit button (col-span-3)
- Touch-safe button sizing (56x56px minimum)
- Visual feedback on hover and press
- Global keyboard event listener

**How to Use:**
1. On login screen, type PIN using physical keyboard
2. Press Enter to submit
3. Press Backspace to delete last digit
4. Press Escape to clear all digits

### 2. Role-Based Access Control System ✅
**Files**: 
- Backend: `apps/python-backend/src/database/models/user.py`, `apps/python-backend/src/api/auth.py`
- Frontend: `apps/electron-app/src/renderer/services/api.ts`, `apps/electron-app/src/renderer/components/Login.tsx`, `apps/electron-app/src/renderer/components/Dashboard.tsx`, `apps/electron-app/src/renderer/App.tsx`

**Features:**
- Changed roles from PRIMARY/STAFF to ADMIN/USER
- First user automatically created as ADMIN
- Subsequent users created as USER
- Backend API enforces role checks
- Frontend hides admin-only screens from regular users
- Route guards prevent unauthorized access

**Features:**
- Minimum 44x44px touch targets (WCAG compliant)
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements
- Visual feedback states (hover, active, focus)
- Accessibility labels (aria-labels)
- Semantic HTML structure

**Touch Target Sizes:**
