## Manual Testing Guide

### Test 1: Keyboard Input on Login Screen
**Steps:**
1. Start the application
2. On the login screen, use physical keyboard to type PIN
3. Type: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
4. Press Enter to submit

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ Each digit appears in the PIN field
- ✓ PIN field shows 6 dots (masked)
- ✓ Enter key submits the PIN
- ✓ No browser default behavior (page scroll, etc.)

**Additional Tests:**
- Type 0-9 and verify all digits work
- Press Backspace and verify last digit is deleted
- Press Escape and verify all digits are cleared
- Verify keyboard works without focusing on keypad

---

### Test 2: Role-Based Access Control
**Steps:**
1. Login with PIN 123456 (admin user)
2. Verify Settings and User Management are visible
3. Create a new user with PIN 111111
4. Logout and login with new user PIN
5. Verify Settings and User Management are hidden

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ Admin user sees all menu items
- ✓ Admin user can create new users
- ✓ New user gets "User" role
- ✓ Regular user cannot see Settings
- ✓ Regular user cannot see User Management
- ✓ Dashboard shows "Administrator" for admin, "User" for regular user
- ✓ API rejects non-admin requests to protected endpoints

---

### Test 3: Touch-Safe UI
**Steps:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M)
3. Set resolution to 1024x768 (tablet)
4. Test clicking all buttons

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ All buttons are easily clickable
- ✓ No accidental taps on adjacent buttons
- ✓ Visual feedback on hover/click
- ✓ Adequate spacing between elements
- ✓ Text is readable on tablet size
- ✓ Layout adapts properly to screen size

---

### Test 4: Visual Feedback States
**Steps:**
1. Hover over keypad buttons
2. Click/press keypad buttons
3. Hover over user selection cards
4. Click user selection cards

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ Buttons scale up on hover (105%)
- ✓ Buttons scale down on press (95%)
- ✓ Shadow effects change on hover
- ✓ Focus ring appears on keyboard navigation
- ✓ Disabled buttons show reduced opacity
- ✓ Active states are clearly visible

---

### Test 5: API Endpoints
**Steps:**
1. Start backend: `cd apps/python-backend && source venv/bin/activate && python -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001`
2. Test endpoints:
   - GET http://localhost:8001/health
   - POST http://localhost:8001/api/auth/initialize
   - POST http://localhost:8001/api/auth/login (with PIN 123456)
   - GET http://localhost:8001/api/auth/users

**Expected Results:**
- ✓ Health check returns healthy status
- ✓ Initialize creates admin user
- ✓ Login returns user with admin role
- ✓ Get users returns list of users
- ✓ All responses include role field
